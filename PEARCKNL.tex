\section{Introduction}
% Move sections 1 and 2 of white paper into introduction

% Move benchmark section (sec. 3) into results
%  Keep matrix dimension and experiment parameter specifics
%  in the results section


\section{Methodology and Approach}
% Methodology/approach section after introduction
  % Pull in from white paper section 3:
  %   1. focus on dense matrix, not sparse
  %   2. Broad discussion of matrix sizes, thread counts, strong scaling
  %   3. emphasize what we were getting at: SNB vs. KNL performance
  %      for similar thread counts and scalability

\section{Results}
% Part c of white paper section 4 to be moved into results section

% Move white paper section sec. into results
%  Keep matrix dimension and experiment parameter specifics
%  in the results section (don't want this detail in Methodology and Approach)

\section{Discussion}
